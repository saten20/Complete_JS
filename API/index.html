<!-- 

The states of an XMLHttpRequest object are:

    UNSENT(0): The initial state, where the XMLHttpRequest client has been created but the open() method has not been called
    OPENED(1): The open() method has been called
    HEADERS_RECEIVED(2): The response headers have been received after the send() method has been called
    LOADING(3): The response is being received, and state 3 repeats every time a data packet is received
    DONE(4): The request is complete

    steps to do the XMLHttpRequest

    step1 - create the XMLHttpRequest instance
            const xhr = new  XMLHttpRequest();
    step2 - call the open method which will take two argument first type of request and second location
            xhr.open('GET', url)
    step 3 - perform the operation on onreadystatechange
            xhr.onreadystatechange = ()=>{}
            xhr.readyState will give us the integer value that represent the ready state

            this.responseText will give us the response in the string formate that we have to convert it into json using
            JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)

    step 4 - xhr.send()
    
    javascript is wrapper on C++. i.e js is written on c++.
