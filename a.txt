Hello sir,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Satendra Yadav, and I am currently in my final year of MCA at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka.
I am reaching out to inquire if you would be open to referring me for Software Engineer - YG (Job Number: 24000N9Q) at Societe Generale.
I have attached my resume and LeetCode profile for your reference.
I believe my strong foundation in programming, problem-solving skills, and relevant project experience would allow me to contribute meaningfully to the team.
